What to expect.

For travelers looking to do some underwater exploration in Bali, Tulamben is the perfect destination. Begin your adventure with an easy transfer to this small village on the northeast coast of Bali. The USS Liberty sits just offshore in about 30 m of water, allowing easy shore access. Visibility is usually very good at Tulamben. Even snorkelers can see the wreck from the surface! Beginner divers will be closely guided in groups of two by a professional PADI instructor so they can view the wreck safely at shallower depths. The wreck, surrounding coral, and abundant life makes this a great introduction to the underwater world for dive newbies. For experienced divers, a dive master will guide a group of four to explore the wreck at greater depths, and advanced divers will have a chance for a swim-through in the wreck’s interior. The Liberty is an incredible location for underwater photos, which you can request from the operator in advance for an additional fee.
