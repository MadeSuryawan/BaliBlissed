<general_rules>
- **Code Formatting**: All code should be formatted using Prettier. Before committing, run `npm run format` to ensure consistent formatting. The configuration is defined in `.prettierrc` (single quotes: false, trailing comma: all, print width: 80, tab width: 4).
- **Linting**: ESLint is used for JavaScript linting. Ensure your code adheres to the ESLint rules defined in `eslint.config.js`.
- **File Placement**: When creating new files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images), always place them in their respective subdirectories within the `src/` folder (e.g., `src/css/`, `src/js/`, `src/images/`). If a relevant subdirectory does not exist, create one.

<repository_structure>
This repository contains the source code for "BaliBlissed", a static travel agency website, with a small Node.js backend for contact form submissions.

- **`src/`**: This is the main source directory for the website's frontend.
    - `src/css/`: Contains the main stylesheet (`style.css`).
    - `src/js/`: Contains JavaScript files, including `main.js` and modules for various functionalities (e.g., `testimonialsController.js`, `contactForm.js`).
    - `src/destinations/`: Contains individual HTML pages for different travel destinations.
    - `src/pages/`: Contains general website pages like `about.html`, `faq.html`, `privacy-policy.html`, and `terms-of-service.html`.
    - `src/includes/`: Contains reusable HTML components like `header.html` and `footer.html`.
    - `src/public/`: Contains static assets like `icons/`, `images/`, `json_data/`, `robots.txt`, and `sitemap.xml`.
- **`dist/`**: This directory is for the production-ready build of the website, generated by Vite. It is typically empty in the repository and populated during the build process.
- **`python/`**: This directory contains Python scripts, including `main.py` and `helpers.py`, likely used for specific automation tasks related to the website content (e.g., updating hero images as suggested by `pyproject.toml`).
- **`server.js`**: This file implements a small Node.js Express server responsible for handling contact form submissions via Nodemailer.
- **`package.json`**: Defines Node.js project metadata, scripts, and dependencies for the frontend build process (Vite) and the Node.js backend.

<dependencies_and_installation>
The repository has two main sets of dependencies: Node.js for the frontend build and backend server, and Python for specific scripts.

- **Node.js Dependencies**:
    - **Installation**: Navigate to the root of the repository and run `npm install`. This will install all necessary Node.js packages listed in `package.json`.
    - **Running Development Server**: After installation, you can start the local development server with live reload by running `npm run dev`.
    - **Building for Production**: To create a production build in the `dist/` directory, run `npm run build`.
- **Python Dependencies**:
    - **Installation**: The Python scripts in the `python/` directory have their dependencies listed in `python/requirements.txt` and `python/pyproject.toml`. It is recommended to use a virtual environment. You can install them using `pip install -r python/requirements.txt` or by using `uv` if available, as indicated by `uv.lock`.

<testing_instructions>
Currently, there are no formal testing frameworks (e.g., Jest, Mocha, Pytest) or dedicated test suites configured in this repository. Code validation primarily relies on linting (ESLint) and manual testing during development. Internal logic within JavaScript modules may include basic validation (e.g., regex tests for email formats), but these are not part of a comprehensive testing framework.
