                    Embark on an extraordinary underwater journey to Tulamben, a
                    quaint village on Bali's northeast coast, renowned globally
                    for housing one of the most accessible and captivating wreck
                    dives: the USS Liberty. Torpedoed in World War II, this
                    impressive cargo ship rests just meters from the shore in
                    shallow waters (5-30m), making it easily reachable even for
                    snorkelers who can glimpse its outline from the surface!
                </p>
                <p>
                    This day trip offers an incredible opportunity for divers of
                    all abilities. If you're new to diving, our professional
                    PADI instructors will guide you in small groups (max 2
                    divers per instructor), ensuring a safe and comfortable
                    introduction as you explore the shallower sections of the
                    wreck, now encrusted with vibrant corals and teeming with
                    colorful fish. It's a breathtaking first glimpse into the
                    underwater world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For certified divers, our experienced PADI Dive Masters lead
                    small groups (max 4 divers) to delve deeper into the wreck's
                    structure. Explore cargo holds, swim alongside massive
                    bumphead parrotfish, and keep an eye out for larger pelagics
                    like black-tip reef sharks or even the elusive mola mola
                    (sunfish) and whale sharks during the right season. Advanced
                    divers may even have the chance for thrilling swim-throughs
                    within the wreck's interior. With typically excellent
                    visibility and an abundance of marine biodiversity, the USS
                    Liberty promises an unforgettable dive experience, expertly
                    managed by one of Bali's most reputable dive operators.
